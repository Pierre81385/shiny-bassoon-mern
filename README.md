# What is it?

Find a bunch of fucking weirdos saying weird fucking things to one another. Create an account and jump into the discussion AOL chatroom style!

## Why is it cool?

It's been a while since I used React for a project, so this is a full MERN stack application, incorperating Axios, JWT, Bootstrap, and Socket.io. This is the first time I'll be implementing websockets in an application!

- Mongodb for storing user documents, while room documents store arrays of room members and chat transcripts.
- Express.js and Node.js provide the backend server and API helped by Axios for requests, and JSON Web Tokens for authroization management.
- React.js with Bootstrap provides the frontend.
- Bringing everything together in real time, I've implemented a Socket.io server as the websocket provider.

### Jump in by installing the dependencies and running `npm run start`.

Concurrently will start the backend server at `http://localhost:4200` to access Mongodb, a Socket.io server will listen at `http://localhost:4200` for any updates, and the frontend is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
